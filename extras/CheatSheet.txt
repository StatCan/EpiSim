BEGIN Step 1: Building package EpiSim (ingredients are in folder EpiSim )

A) In DOS window, go to folder that contains the folder you want to build (e.g. go to ...\Build_This if want to build ...\Build_This\EpiSim )
B) Issue command R CMD build EpiSim
   Note that if you added R's path to Window's %path%, you can only type R.exe to invoke it from anywhere.
   In R/Rstudio, R.home() will give the path R is in.
   If R is not added to your Window's %path%, your call to R needs to include its path as shown in exhibit below

    * checking for file 'EpiSim/DESCRIPTION' ... OK
    * preparing 'EpiSim':

    * checking for LF line-endings in source and make files and shell scripts
    * checking for empty or unneeded directories
    * creating default NAMESPACE file

BEGIN Step 3: Use package

install.packages("C:/Users/nadecla/Documents/R/win-library/EpiSim_0.12.12.tar.gz",repos=NULL,type="source")
library(EpiSim)

print(sessionInfo(),locale=FALSE) # shows EpiSim_0.12.12 (among other things)
help(try.various.parms.values) # shows documentation for EpiSim package's try.various.parms.values function.
